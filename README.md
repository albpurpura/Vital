### Common Topics

**1. Managing Your Data**
Vital uses local storage to keep your diary entries and custom recipes private and fast. Ensure your device has enough storage space for the best experience.

**2. Accuracy & Databases**
We use high-quality nutrition databases. If you find a barcode that isn't recognized, you can manually add the food to your personal library using the "Create Food" feature.

**3. Goals & Progress**
You can update your daily calorie and macronutrient targets at any time in the settings to reflect your changing fitness needs.
